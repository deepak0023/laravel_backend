## [Crazy moments]

### Some crazy tools he tried in between

- Tried using postman to check for APIs
- He learnt about creating collections
- And guess what he also hosted the api document on a website with postman short url support [API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/23446250/2s7Z13jNjD)

## [Unreleased]

### Looking out for some damn issue

- Nights watch activated

## [2.9] || >> Release point 3 [User with Todo entity API] [one to many]

- The lazy man tries to bring relation between user table and todo table
- Hopefully it is fine according to him based on the testing he performed from postman
- He Also knows what comes along with it - the beast [The authentication and authorization module]
- He tries to cool himself

## [2.8]

### Added

- The lazy man came back to the issue list
- Created a normal crud operation on user entity without givong much thought onto validations
- Verified it on postman and he also came across methods to have testing script on postman

## [2.7]

### Added

- For the lazy man it has been three days since he has bathed properly , he took his own sweet time being a sunday on that
- He has heard about the SOAP API which was kind of old architecture for webservice data transfer
- Without knowing the complexity involved in creating soap endpoint he tried to give it a try
- He literally got wasted and confused after watching several vedios
- The lines he had between the rest api and soap api got blurred up a little
- He tries out some snippets which are not fully functional but understood how to go about it through postman
- As of now he understands that the ini settings and a php soap driver is to be installed to go about it
- He pushed the rest of the effort to be put on that for another day
- He also thank the gods for having SOAP API's as an outdated standard as a way of escape
- He understands the requirement for understanding the xml parsers and WSDL before getting into this circus 

## [2.6]

### Added

- The lazy man was looking at his accomplishments 
- Suddenly he felt uneasy because he has heard somewhere that file request can be passed through api request
- Now he wants to know how that can be processed in laravel
- He hussles and finds some solutions 
- In the process he also understands how to send file request through postman in different ways

## [2.5] || >> Release point 2 [Todo with Comment entity API] [one to many]

### Added

- The lazy man is back online 
- He was wandering around in the web
- Suddenly he fuond a cleaner implementation of the same relation code 
- He thought of giving it a try and just want to play around and learn the new way 
- He also updated the readme when he spent time to look at that

## [2.4]

### Added

- The lazy man happily merged the code
- Testing was done to an extend but you know he is too lazy for a regurous testing or a regression testing 
- He might be well of having a unit testing setup for a stable version but again he is too lazy for that as of now
- He without a second thought publishes the comment collection API documentation with postman API
- Guess what he understood how to organize postman api request set under seperate folder under a collection in a specific workplace along the way 

## [2.3]

### Changed

- Now the lazy man was looking at the code again
- He is not satisfied since he can see that the code is not on laravel eloquent standards 
- So he tries to make some little changes to show to the world how the model connection works with eloquent eager loading
- Eventhough he knows that the present query makes it bit slower he wants to show that he knows it the laravel way
- One thing he learnt out of it is when to have a query stated with todo model and when it must be with the comments table when there is a join operation
- He is back to his music world again

## [2.2]

### Changed / Added

- Now the lazy man was looking at the code again
- He found that nowhere in the code the comments and todo tables are connected in any way
- Firstly he stated to think how the routes can be defined
- He understood that there is a one to many connection involved between todo and comments
- The rest is history

## [2.1]

### Added

- The lazy man looked on to the issue list and saw a new one pop up
- Now like always he wants to somehow evade from it
- So he created a new branch for the same and came up with this createtive idea
- Now might be thinking how he added this much code within no time but from the inside all he has done is a copy paste with new nomenclature
